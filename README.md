# Tech Blog Project Ver 3.0 With NextJS For SEO, SSR

This is the third version of my tech blog project.
The reason why I refatored ver 2.0 as NextgJS is SPA Websites can't not optimize the SEO tag.
In order to optimize the SEO tag and other optimizaion for SEO, Server Side Rendering (SSR) is essential.
I need to not only study SSR framework as well but I also need to optimize my tech blog site with good SEO.
